# Firebase & ExpressJs Session variables
NodeJS app using a Firebase database on the clientside. As well as Session variables on backend ExpressJs, for comparison.

## What I learnt
* Using Firebase (https://firebase.google.com) in the client, retrieving and setting values.  
* Session variables with ExpressJs.  
* jQuery client DOM manipulation.  
* Ajax calls.  
* Working with Set() to store unique objects, in NodeJs.
* Using different methods to obtain the similar thing - Firebase vs. ExpressJs session variables.
